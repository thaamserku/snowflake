Choose Snowflake Edition, Platform and Region

#### **Snowflake Edition**

-   The Snowflake Edition that you choose determines credit usage and the features that are available. 
-   Enterprise Edition provides balance of all features and services. Business Critical Edition, offers even higher levels of data protection to support the needs of organizations.
-   Unless you are specifically choosing to test features from Business Critical Edition, choose Enterprise Edition.

#### **Cloud Platform Provider**

-   Snowflake could not operate without an underlying cloud provider infrastructure – Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
-   After choosing your infrastructure provider, you do not interact with the cloud provider and you are not charged by them in the management of your Snowflake account.

#### **Geographic Deployment Region**

-   Cloud Providers have Deployment Regions, so Snowflake has Deployment Regions.
-   Deployment Regions are set by the Cloud Provider so your choice of regions is different depending on which Cloud Provider you choose.
-   It is recommended to choose a region close to your physical location. This reduces latency.

### **STEP-3: Activate your account.**

After completing the step-2, you will receive a message stating that an email has been sent to activate your account.
