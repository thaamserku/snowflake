# How to Compare Two Values When One is NULL in Snowflake - PopSQL


Say you're comparing two Snowflake columns and you want to know how many rows are different. No problem, you think:

```sql
select count(1)
from sessions
where start_date != end_date;
```

Wait a minute. If some of the start or end dates are null, they won't be counted! üò¨ That's definitely not what you wanted. That's why you need to use the `INTERSECT` operator:

```sql
select count(1)
from sessions
where not exists(select start_date from sessions intersect select end_date from sessions);
```

Now, your count will be ‚Äúnull aware‚Äù and you'll get the result you want.
